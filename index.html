            <p>

            Jeff Weyen is a Senior at UNO as a non-traditional student. He decided to go back to school
			at the age of 40 to complete his Bachelor's degree in Management Information Systems. This is
			long overdue, but well worth it to open some new doors and also prove to his children that you
			can still do it and be successful if you just put your mind to it and focus on what is important.
			Jeff is an IT Manager currently and has been doing IT work for over 20 years. Outside of work he
			spends time with his wife and kids and enjoys getting outside as much as possible. Do things such
			as hunting, fishing, or playing sports it really doesn't matter as long as he gets to get away
			from the office.
